# Keras-Slack-Logging
A simple example of how to send updates from your keras experiments to slack 


## **Disclaimers:**
1. This is _one_ of the ways to do this, and there are perhaps better ways to do this than what I've shown here.

2. The objective of this notebook is **not** to show some model train to SOTA, so the hyperparameters are randomly chosen just to show the model training.

3. For specific usage questions, check out the [WebClient API](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api)

**What's not covered here:**
I will be writing a blog post to accompany this notebook to walk through some of the things that are not covered here:

1. Setting up your slack workspace
2. Creating a bot and a slack api token
3. Possible Kaggle Integration
